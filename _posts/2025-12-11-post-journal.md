## Solenoid 

I found a different source when trying to create a solenoid and I asked Chatgpt what the problem could be. It said that the gauge of my wire could be too low and that I did not have enough turns on my solenoid. I then ordered 18 gauge wire like Chat had suggested. Then I decided to get the solenoid done so I used the 36 gauge wire and wrapped it around the new nail spool with the electric drill. I turned it until I thought that it was enough turns. I sanded the ends when I was done turning but class was over.
