## Solenoid

I tried again and thought that maybe the problem was that my pole was too big. However, after testing the spool with a smaller pole it would act like a magnet but not pull the pole to the center of the solenoid like in the video I viewed. I then researched a bit more and found a tutorial on how to make one from scratch. I plan to use this tutorial next class.
