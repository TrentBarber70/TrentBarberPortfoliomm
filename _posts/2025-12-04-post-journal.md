## Solenoid

I tried again and thought that maybe the problem was that my pole was too big. However, after testing the spool with a smaller pole. the new pole would act like a magnet but not pull the pole to the center of the solenoid like in the video I viewed. I then researched a bit more and found a tutorial on how to make one from scratch. I plan to use this tutorial next class.

Tools used 
3D printer

Items used 
22 gauge copper wire 
3D printed spool
screw
AA batteries
