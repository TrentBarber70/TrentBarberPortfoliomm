## Creating a solenoid

I have spent the last few days researching and creating the spools for a few "example" solenoids but they wouldn't work. At first I would hand spin them but that prooved to be too tiring and the coil would be too lose to create the magnetic feild necessary.I looked back to the tutorials and used Chat-gpt to help answer the question of why my solenoid wouldn't work. It was not working because I did not have enought turns around the spool and the gauge of the wire was too high which would cause the coil to heat up very quickly. On monday the 15th I will attempt to spin the wire around the spool but this time I'll make sure to give the spool a large ammount of turns so I can see how powerfull it is.  

When I finished the solenoid I sanded down the ends of the wires to test for continuity

I used 12v of AA batteries hooked up in series to test this working solenoid.
