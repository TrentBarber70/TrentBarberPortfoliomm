I Finished the baseplate for the mechanism and finished the holder for the new 12v solenoid on the baseplate and made screw holes for both parts. I began work on the bushing today and finished it. I also made a model solenoid for the flipper mechanism so I can line up the connecting plate once I finish the rest of the mechanism. Tomorrow I plan to make the flipper lever that will be underneath the baseplate to move the flipper and switch the solenoid to 5v to hold and cradle the ball at a safe amperage.
