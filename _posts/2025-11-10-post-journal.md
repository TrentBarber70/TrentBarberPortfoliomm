## Scoring device day 1 

I have begun work on making a scoring device that will react to the ball hitting it by lighting up and printing out a score whenever the microswitch is tapped. This mechanic is intergral to the pinball machine because it will give the player a sense of reactivity. i have started to code the device so that every time I press the button the light will go off and the device will print "67".
