## Solenoid 

Today I have created the stl on fusion for my new solenoid. After watching that video I found that the key to making a solenoid is to limit how much air is between the spool and pole. I then printed the new spool and wrapped the spool with the rest of the 22 gauge wire. Class ended before I could test it.
