## Working on Git webpage 

Today I worked on updating my github webpage. I started by making edits to my final project post and extended my summary about how my project is different from the source material. I then added my CNC and STL files from the topography project and added the files as links to download from the webpage. I then finished the day by adding a post about the Kicad homework I did.
