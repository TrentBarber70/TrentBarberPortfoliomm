Today I wasn't able to do much today in class but at home I finished the flipper lever and learned how to use the align tool. I then aligned the parts that I made into posistion and printed a few example screw holes ranging from 4.10 mm in diameter to 4.08 mm. I found that the .08 mm is a tight of enough tolerance to use the screws to hold themselves. I also then found that I wouldn't need the bushing spacer because my screws are long enough that the spacer isn't needed. I also tested my 24v solenoid with a button circuit just to see how powerfull its force was.
