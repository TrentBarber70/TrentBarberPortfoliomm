## Solenoid 

I tested the solenoid and it did not work. This time I used the power supply in the other room and adjusted it to 12v and the pole would not move. I then finished class by further researching solenoids. 

Tools used 
- Power supply
- 3D printer 
- Drill

Items used 
- 36 gauge copper wire 
- 3D printed spool
