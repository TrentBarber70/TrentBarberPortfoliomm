## Plunger 

After buying springs for my launcher I found out that they were too small for the rod of the plunger so I decided to move onto a more pressing matter of the project which is the Flippers and pop bumpers. I did some research and found that they both are controlled by solenoids. After talking with Mrs. Morrow I found that they aren't that hard to make and will start work on the solenoids when we come back from Thanksgiving break.
