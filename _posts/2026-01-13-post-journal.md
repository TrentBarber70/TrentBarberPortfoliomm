Today I found a video on Youtube by Daniel Tartaglia about making a pinball flipper mechanism. I plan to replicate his design because it is easy to see how the parts will move. I began making this design by starting with the base plate and working my way off of that. I will continue work on the flipper mechanism tomorrow by making the screw holes for the 12v solenoid that Mr. Dubick bought today.
