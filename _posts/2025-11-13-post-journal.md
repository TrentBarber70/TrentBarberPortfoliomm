## Scoring device and Plunger 

I have finished the scoring device and decided to have all the buttons have the same value because the player has easy acess to all the buttons. I then started to create the launcher for the pinball machine. 

Tools used 
- none 

Items used 
- bread board 
- rapsberry pi pico
- Gumdrop LEDs
- Jumper wires
- Micro switches
