Today I purchased the 24v solenoid that I need for the pinball machine, After purchasing the solenoid I created a draft task analysis sheet on google docs so that I can paln out the rest of my project. After creating the sheet I found a tutorial on how to make 3D printable pinball flipper mechanisms and pop bumpers. Lastly, I created the holder for my arriving solenoid on Fusion 360.
