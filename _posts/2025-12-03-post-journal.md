## Solenoid 

It is the first day back from break. I am working on the Solenoid. I created a spool and used the 22 awg wire that was in the cabinet to wrap the solenoid by hand. I then sanded down the ends once I was finished wrapping and tested for continuity before I wired it to a 9v DC battery. The pole of the solenoid was a large screw I found in the fablab. I couldn't tell if it was pulling down on the screw but the coil was getting warmer which meant that the current was flowing.
