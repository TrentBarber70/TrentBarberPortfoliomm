Today I am mostly finished with the solenoid holder and I printed the holder and found that it did not fit the solenoid. So I will go back to the drawing board and fix the mistakes in my original design for the solenoid holder.

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/Soelnoidholder.png' | relative_url }}" alt="IMG_0677" style="max-width:650px;width:100%;height:auto;display:block;margin:18px 0;"> 

In this design I am missing a slot in the bacj of the holder for the end of the solenoid to fire out, and the design lacks holes for the wires.
I will fox these issue before school tommorow.
