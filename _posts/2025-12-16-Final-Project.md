# Final Project 

## Description 
My project for the 2025-2026 Advance topics in Engineering course is a half-size Pinaball machine. 
I was inspired to start this project after viewing a video by Thepinballroom on Youtube. I also was inspired by the 1999 NBA live pinball machine because I like how interactive it was with the user. 
My project will be diferent from the source project because I plan to incorporate a multiball function into the pinball machine's gameplay that will also trigger a cutscene through an audio que.

## What I've completed 

As of today I have created the solenoid for the pinball machine, the plunger, a pop-up scorer, and an example housing for the pinball machine.

## Issues and Mistakes 

Some issues that I've been having is the process in making a solenoid. Though I did my reasearch I had made the mistake of not making enough turns around the spool with the 36 awg wire. Furthermore, the gauge of wire that I was using was very thin which meant that the wire would have less resistance and heat up very quickly when I would run the circuit. Then when I tested my first solenoid in October the issue that I had was that there was not enough current to create a strong pull and the air gap was too big in the solenoid. As of 12-15-2025 I have a workign solenoid that has many turns and the pole is a nail that pulls when running 12v with a current of .8. Another mistake that has held progress back is the inability to test how many turns are on the spool without cutting the wire. When the wire is cut there is no way to extend the length or reactach the wire. I have gone though many versions of the solenoid which has wasted much material. I will research a way of finding how many turns the spool has before cutting the wire. One issue that I have ran into is that my nail solenoid is very weak and can not fight against the force of the spring and will not pull all the way down.
