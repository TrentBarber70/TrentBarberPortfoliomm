Today I reprinted the Flipper bat because it broke off in my bag today and I tested the flipper in action with 18.53v and it reached 3.56 amps. I plan to force the 12v solenoid to start the cycle with 18v but then quickly switch to 5v by pressing a button on the baseplate. I learned about this quick and easy way of making a EOS switch through Daneil Tartaglia's video.
